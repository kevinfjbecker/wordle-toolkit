# Wordle Toolkit

An ultralight tool that takes two strings, included and excluded letters, and returns a count of the possible words and (commented out) the list of those words.

The [word list](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/sgb-words.txt) comes from Donald Knuth's [GraphBase](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/sgb.html) page.
